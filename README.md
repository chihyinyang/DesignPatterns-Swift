# DesignPatterns-Swift
After working as an iOS developer for 2 years, I think the most important thing to efficiently maintain the apps in programming, is to build a good structure, and design patterns will bring the ideas. That's the main reason I wrote down the notes about design patterns here. If there is any better descriptions or examples, please feel free let me know, i will super appreciate your help 🫶🏻.

Most of design patterns are aim to decouple, but heavy code is the side effect from using them. There is no the best code, but better code. When to apply the design patterns is all depends on our experiences.
