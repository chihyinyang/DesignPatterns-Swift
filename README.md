# DesignPatterns-Swift
After working as an iOS developer for 2 years, I think the most important thing to efficiently maintain the apps in programming, is to build a good structure, and design patterns will bring the ideas. That's the main reason I wrote down the notes about design patterns here. If there is any better descriptions or examples, please feel free let me know, i will super appreciate your help 🫶🏻.
